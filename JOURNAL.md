# 21/9/2025: started and almost finished the scheme
Choose arduino nano chip for the size and numbber of io pins,
7 segment 4 digit display yellow,blue,red color,
found and wired chips for battery protection and charging,
usb type-c for its accessibility,
ch340n for usb to arduino data conversion,
will be using thermistor and arduino calculating capabilities to check the temparature of the room,
Virtualy wired the pins from the microcontroller to the display and to usb signal convertor,
also chose and wired the rotor switch for hour/minute/date nummber changing while the clock is on

**Total time spent: 7h**
# 23/9/2025: almost finished the layout, loaded the 3d model
changing some minor details  and checking for any mistakes,
planing on making 2 versions for 12pin and 14 pin 0.56 displays,
thinking in changing the usb-c port into an mid board one so it would take les vertical space,
